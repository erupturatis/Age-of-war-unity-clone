# Age-of-war-unity-clone
One of the repositories spawned [by this monstrosity](https://github.com/erupturatis/Age-of-war-AI/tree/master)

###Why?
I needed a reliable age of war clone in unity for training NEAT algorithm on up to 50 environments with 10x speed. It was made entirely as a need for the project mentioned above, read more about the process there.
<br/>
This is a minimalistic version of the game that is meant to use as few resources as possible and just run the numbers. If you want to add things like animations to it, you can take the sprites and look through the codebase in the archieve containing [Age of war](https://github.com/erupturatis/Decompiled-flash-games-archive)

####Usage
This being written an year after finishing this project, I will admit I had no clue at that time and didn't bother to think how I should make this project maintanable or reproducible so I have no idea if it still works. Cloning it and adding it to unity hub should be enough to get it going in theory. Feel free to leave an issue if it doesn't work
